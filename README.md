This is a portfolio of various Java and C# related projects completed in school or for self-practice.

There are three school projects and some Unity C# project files to show off programming skills and learning capabilities. 
Further descriptions for each project can be read in text files labeled "ProjectClarification.txt" in each of the project folders.

To see the unity projects running in real time, please visit their respective pages:

Sample text input files have been provided (if applicable) for school Java projects to give more context
as to the type of information the code handled. The sample input files can be found under text files with
names such as "hwXinX.txt".
