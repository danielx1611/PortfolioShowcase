# Boggle Player Project

### This is a group project, as seen in the BogglePlayer.java code header.

Note : My teammate Luka and I did the programming for this project together, bouncing
ideas off of one another and implementing our solutions as a team. We worked 
together to solve any bugs and to come up with better, more efficient solutions
to our design.

### Context for code:
The game of Boggle has a player try to gain as many points as possible by moving
around a 4x4 board of random letters to form a word, with longer words giving a larger sum of points.
The competition for this project on a class sized scale was to produce the highest
scores possible at the quickest speeds. 

The "score" for the project was determined based on the points earned on each Boggle board,
the time required to get those points, and the memory usage of the program. Therefore, only 
highly efficient and high scoring programs would receive good scores.

The team successfully produced the most efficient and highest scoring code of 
all of the groups of students (around 30-40 students total) in the class.
